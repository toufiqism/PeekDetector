# Automatic Report Export Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the automatic report export feature that was added to PeekDetector v1.4.0.

## Feature Description
The app now automatically exports all detection reports to the device's Downloads folder every 24 hours. Reports are exported in three formats (JSON, CSV, and text summary) and compressed into a single ZIP file.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Dependencies Added
- **WorkManager** (androidx.work:work-runtime-ktx:2.9.1)
  - Used for scheduling periodic background tasks
  - Battery-efficient with system-optimized execution
  - Guaranteed execution even if app is closed

### 2. New Components Created

#### ReportExportHelper.kt
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/tofiq/peekdetector/ReportExportHelper.kt`

**Purpose**: Handles the actual export logic
**Key Features**:
- Fetches all detection events from Room database
- Creates three report formats:
  - **JSON**: Machine-readable format with complete data
  - **CSV**: Spreadsheet-compatible format
  - **Text Summary**: Human-readable summary with statistics
- Compresses all reports into a ZIP file
- Saves to Downloads folder using MediaStore API (Android 10+ compatible)
- Handles cleanup of temporary files
- Proper error handling with null checks

**Key Methods**:
- `exportReportsToDownloads()`: Main export orchestration
- `fetchAllDetections()`: Retrieves all detection events
- `createJsonReport()`: Creates JSON format report
- `createCsvReport()`: Creates CSV format report
- `createSummaryReport()`: Creates text summary with statistics
- `zipReportFiles()`: Compresses reports into ZIP
- `saveToDownloads()`: Saves ZIP to Downloads folder
- `cleanupTempFiles()`: Removes temporary files

#### ReportExportWorker.kt
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/tofiq/peekdetector/ReportExportWorker.kt`

**Purpose**: WorkManager worker for periodic execution
**Key Features**:
- Extends CoroutineWorker for coroutine support
- Shows progress notification while exporting
- Shows success/failure notifications with details
- Graceful error handling with retry logic
- Skips notification if no data to export

**Notification Channels**:
- **Channel ID**: `report_export_channel`
- **Importance**: Default (non-intrusive)
- **Notifications**:
  - Progress: "Exporting Reports..."
  - Success: "Reports Exported" with file location
  - Failure: "Report Export Failed" with error message

#### MainActivity.kt Updates
Location: `app/src/main/java/com/tofiq/peekdetector/MainActivity.kt`

**Changes**:
- Added WorkManager imports
- Added `scheduleReportExport()` method
- Schedules periodic work on app startup
- Uses `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy.KEEP` to avoid duplicates

**Scheduling Configuration**:
- Interval: 24 hours (1 day)
- Policy: KEEP existing work (prevents duplicate schedulers)
- Work Name: `report_export_work`

### 3. Permissions

#### AndroidManifest.xml
No new runtime permissions required! The implementation uses MediaStore API which doesn't require explicit storage permissions on Android 13+ (API 33+).

**Added Comments**:
```xml
<!-- Storage permissions for exporting reports to Downloads folder -->
<!-- Note: For API 33+, MediaStore API is used which doesn't require explicit permissions -->
<!-- READ_MEDIA_* permissions may be needed if reading user files, but not for our app-generated reports -->
```

### 4. Export File Structure

When exported, the ZIP file contains three files:

```
PeekDetector_Reports_[timestamp].zip
├── detection_report_[timestamp].json
├── detection_report_[timestamp].csv
└── detection_summary_[timestamp].txt
```

#### JSON Format Example
```json
{
  "exportDate": "20251029_143025",
  "totalDetections": 42,
  "totalFaces": 97,
  "detections": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "faceCount": 2,
      "timestamp": 1698589200000,
      "dateTime": "2025-10-29 14:30:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### CSV Format Example
```csv
ID,Face Count,Timestamp (ms),Date Time
1,2,1698589200000,"2025-10-29 14:30:00"
2,3,1698589800000,"2025-10-29 14:40:00"
```

#### Summary Format
Contains:
- Export date and report period
- Statistics (total, average, min, max faces)
- Severity breakdown (low vs high severity detections)
- Recent detections (last 10)

## Technical Highlights

### SOLID Principles Followed
1. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
   - ReportExportHelper: Export logic only
   - ReportExportWorker: WorkManager integration only

2. **Open/Closed**: Easy to extend with new report formats without modifying existing code

3. **Dependency Injection**: Worker receives Context through constructor

4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout
   - Graceful handling of null values
   - Try-catch blocks for all file operations
   - Result type for success/failure communication

### Best Practices
- ✅ Unidirectional data flow (database → helper → worker)
- ✅ SSOT pattern (database is single source of truth)
- ✅ Null safety throughout
- ✅ Proper resource cleanup
- ✅ Battery-efficient background processing
- ✅ User notifications for transparency
- ✅ MediaStore API for scoped storage compliance
- ✅ No manual intervention required

### Android Compatibility
- **Minimum SDK**: 33 (Android 13)
- **Target SDK**: 36 (Android 15)
- **Storage**: MediaStore API (scoped storage compliant)
- **Background Work**: WorkManager (Doze mode compatible)

## User Experience

### Automatic Operation
1. App schedules export on first launch
2. WorkManager executes every 24 hours
3. User sees notification when export completes
4. ZIP file available in Downloads folder
5. No manual intervention needed

### Notifications
- **Progress**: Shows while exporting (ongoing)
- **Success**: Shows completion with file location (dismissible)
- **Failure**: Shows error message if export fails (dismissible)

### File Location
- **Path**: Downloads folder (standard Android location)
- **Filename**: `PeekDetector_Reports_[timestamp].zip`
- **Access**: Available through Files app or any file manager

## Testing Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Export creates ZIP file in Downloads folder
- [ ] ZIP contains all three report formats
- [ ] JSON format is valid and parseable
- [ ] CSV opens correctly in spreadsheet apps
- [ ] Summary text is readable and accurate
- [ ] Statistics calculations are correct
- [ ] Notifications appear at appropriate times
- [ ] Export works with zero detections (shows appropriate message)
- [ ] Export works with large dataset (1000+ detections)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] No detections recorded (should skip export gracefully)
- [ ] Insufficient storage space (should show error notification)
- [ ] App killed during export (should retry on next interval)
- [ ] Multiple export attempts (should use KEEP policy)
- [ ] Device reboot (should reschedule work)

### Performance
- [ ] Export completes in reasonable time (< 30 seconds for 1000 records)
- [ ] No memory leaks during export
- [ ] Temp files cleaned up properly
- [ ] Battery impact is minimal
- [ ] No UI thread blocking

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Improvements
1. **Configurable Schedule**: Allow users to choose export frequency
2. **Cloud Backup**: Upload to Google Drive or Dropbox
3. **Email Export**: Send reports via email
4. **Selective Export**: Choose date ranges or time periods
5. **Auto-Delete Old Exports**: Clean up old ZIP files automatically
6. **Export on Demand**: Manual export button in UI
7. **Share Option**: Direct share from notification
8. **Encryption**: Password-protect exported files
9. **Format Selection**: Let users choose which formats to export
10. **Compression Level**: Configurable ZIP compression

## Troubleshooting

### Export Not Working
1. Check notification tray for error messages
2. Verify device has sufficient storage space
3. Ensure at least one detection is recorded
4. Check app isn't battery restricted
5. Try clearing app cache and restarting

### Files Not Found
1. Open Files app and navigate to Downloads
2. Look for files starting with "PeekDetector_Reports_"
3. Check if export has run (wait 24 hours after first launch)
4. Check notification history for export status

### Performance Issues
1. Large datasets may take longer to export
2. Consider implementing pagination or chunking
3. Monitor memory usage during export
4. Use WorkManager constraints (charging, wifi) for large exports
